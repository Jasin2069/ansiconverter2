    The header line has a "solid" space Alt-225 at the beginning and the end
    of the line, to help "frame" it in the background color, here is the
    line in the same color, with out the solid spaces.

                     Sample Background Color Effects 

    Notice the difference, in this particular case, None. It really depends
    on your editor. If leaving a normal space does not give the effect
    you want, use the solid space.

    I mentioned having a paragraph in a different background color, and the
    effects of not having a code for the standard color at the end of each
    line. As you may have noticed, our "standard" color in this message is
    Cyan on Black. Now lets go for Bright Yellow on Blue, without the ending
    color codes.

    This paragraph is Brite Yellow on Blue. The code for this color has only
    been placed at the beginning of the Paragraph. And this is the effect
    you get!

    The color stops at the last character of each line, and the leading
    spaces at the beginning, are changed to Blue.

    Now we do it again, this time, we place the Bright Yellow on Blue code   
    at the beginning, and the Cyan On Black at the end of each line. On      
    short lines, we place it so we will have  the same size blue background, 
    all through the paragraph.                                               

   The repetative color codes above were entered one time, on the first
   line, then pasted with the editor block marking - pasteing function.
   This paragraph has no code at the beginning, because the last code read,
   was our standard color, Cyan On Black, at the end of the last line in the
   previous paragraph.

 are	 EASY with T2A, just type in your text, then go

   A point to mention....when you do what we have here, with lots of codes
   and words on one line, you may want to set your right margin to 255, so
   there is no accidental word wrap.
   If you enter ALL your text first, use about 76 as a right margin,
   then set to 255 to enter all the color and variable codes.

  p I hope this Background Color Example is of some help to you. I think you  
  p will find T2A a useful tool, and once you get used to it, easy to use. It 
  p sometimes seems like a lot of work, but you will find that for certian    
  p things, its the only way to go!                                           

  Another note: You see some flashing colors here, entered with the
  caret character, the Blinking Attribute code is one of the Registered Only
  features.

          Now go create something.....and Thanks! for trying T2A
